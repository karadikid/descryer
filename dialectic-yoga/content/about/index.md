Dialectic Yoga (DiY) integrates the methods its founder used to go from suicidally depressed, drunk, and nearly homeless to the top 1% of his field.  He charted a gut-wrenching process through Hades to recover himself from darkness.  Although you may not require his flair for the melodramatic, you will experience challenges equally intense upon your quest, both internal and external.  However using DiY you will be able to learn faster and climb further with fewer near fatal mistakes.  No need for you to join the Army, go to jail or survive addiction.  You don't need to lose family members or worse - unless you want to.   

DiY is for those that want to scale the peaks now rather than later.  Those who want to integrate their shadow side and call him friend.
