Follow our Yogas and Develop Your Body Mind and Intellect.

Enter any gym and you see, "Yoga Classes."  But what does Yoga mean?  In this context it generally refers to the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali compiled around 500 BC.  Specifically, to the quote "Yoga citta vritti nirodah."  Or, "to yoke consciousness to the cessation of the agitations of the mind."

Before analyzing this Sloka or verse more thoroughly, one must understand that multple Yogas exist in ancient Vedanta, the soure material for what Westerners call Hinduism.  There is in fact no Hindu religon, this moniker comes from the British calling people of the Indus River Valley civilizaton "Sindus," or "Hindus."

The actual philosophy sources from the Vedas, the oldest religious texts in the world clocking in some form for at least 5000 years.  We say it comes from the people who lived before the flood in the last Ice Age.  They carried their wisdom into the mountains as the waters rose.  They entitled this philosophy of living, "Sanatana Dharma," Universal Law.

As you chart your journey and that of humanity as a whole, I will offer you multiple ways of entering and exiting these toolsets.  You will find their universal applicability refreshing.  Their inclusivivity novel.  To give a simple example, Vedic cosmology lasts through multiple Big Bang events chronologizing up to 4.2 trillion years!

Before the rest of the world had indoor plumbing, the vedic peoples knew the paths of heavenly bodies in heliocentric orbit.  Yet they also knew the fact that the souce of all agitation comes from the mind's incessant problem solving.  The core Yoga I will train you in, is the cessation of the mind.  Once this happens it becomes your willing companion on a noble quest.

## The Five Points of Yoga

My yoga lineage traces back all the way to the father of Advaita Vedanta, Adi Sankaracharya.  He lived sometime between 500 BC and 700 AD. I initiated through Sivananda Bahamas Ashram founded by Swami Vishnudevananda in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1959.  You will learn more about my path and how it might parallel yours later.  It includes many other institutions not limited to the Latter Day Saints Church, Catholic School, Boarding School, UC Berkeley, the US Army and many others some less savory than others.

What matters most here are the five points of Yoga as Sivananda teaches.  They each focus the aspirants efforts for yoga citta vritti nirodah, or oneness.  The Greeks called this unity of Spirit, Body and Mind.  Anyone dedicated to craft knows this as loss of self in somethin greater.  Properly lived Yoga exists in this space at all times.


1. Proper Exercise – Āsana

Each of these steps manages parts of the human entity:  Body, Energy, Mind, Intellect

## Our Path

My path up the mountain to the summit of human consciousness included ridiculous amounts of friction and frustration as each time I ascended I came down with a different form.  On the first trip I returned a fiery intellectual philosopher ready to slay any false gods and idols.  On another trip I descended into darkness returning beaten and alone.  Each time I refined a different aspect of the human condition.  Finally I am an integrated whole who can save you all the dead-ends on your journey.
