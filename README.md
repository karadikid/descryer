# Descryer - The decentralized blogging platform.

## Introduction
From the heady days of 2009 comes Satoshi Nakamoto with the original Bitcoin Whitepaper.  The genesis, or first, block contains the headline from the Financial Times, "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."  Just over ten years later our economic system has continued to debase its currency through opening unlimited US Federal Reserve financial backing.

Yet this tine Decentralized Finance (DeFI) exists to try to proide an offramp to avoid thus excess.  The author of this project has followed and supported Cryptocurrency since sometime in 2013.  Sadly he sold his $400/Bitcoin (BTC) in 2017.  Hence to learn about DeFI he tries to read the top Financial Services (FinServ) blogs in the fledgling industry.  Unfortunately subscribing to them is a frictional experience at best.  It genreally requires Fiat, paper money printed by "fiat" or royal edict, or has a horrific onramp.

The firt rule of being a Hacker is to solve a problen you have yourself and solve it once.

1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.
2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.

## Problem Statement
Author wants to travel the new decentralized world to build an Internet of freedom.  To learn about this world he has to pay the warden of Reserve Banking.

### Solution
Build a decentralizd blogging platform with a cryptocurrency onramp.

## Business Requirements

1. Confidentiality
2. Integrity
3. Availability
## Technical Requirements (Tech Spec)

1. The surest way to ensure something has integrity in the current environment is through hashing or digital signing such as hash-based message functions. Interplanetary Linked Data (IPLD) (Multihash)
2. Confidentiality can come from Public/Private Key Cryptography.  (PKI)
3. Availability from  Distributed Hash Table (DHT) such as BitTorrent.

## Technical Specifications
### Core Infrastructure
Interplanetary File System (IPFS), Interplanetary Name System (IPNS), Interplanetary Linked Data (IPLD), libp2p meet the core infrastructure needs as hosted by FileCoin.
### Platform
Textile.io has created a platform which includes encryption, subscription and accounting.

# Hackathon
[HackFS](https://hackfs.com) has offered a Hackathon to build new applications, services or tools on FileCoin as sponsored by ETHGlobal and Protocol Labs.

### Our goals:

1. Learn how to collaborate in the new decentralized open source world through solving challenges together.
2. Join and meet the community and fellow freedom fighters on the Decentralized Web.
3. Build a working prototype of a hosted subscripton blog.
4. OPTIONAL: Have a payment onramp through blockchain cryptocurrencies such as DAI or other.
