# Descryer - The decentralized blogging platform.

## Introduction

From the heady days of 2009 comes Satoshi Nakamoto with the original Bitcoin Whitepaper. The genesis, or first, block contains the headline from the Financial Times, "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks." Just over ten years later our economic system has continued to debase its currency through opening unlimited US Federal Reserve financial backing.

Yet this time Decentralized Finance (DeFI) exists to try to proide an offramp to avoid this excess. The author of this project has followed and supported Cryptocurrency since sometime in 2013. Alas, he sold his \$400/Bitcoin (BTC) in 2017 at tidy profit some say. Hence to learn about DeFI he reads the top Financial Services (FinServ) blogs in the fledgling industry such as the [Defiant](https://thedefiant.substack.com). Unfortunately subscribing to them genreally requires Fiat, paper money printed by "fiat" or royal edict, or has a horrific onramp.

As Eric Raymond states from ["The Cathedral and the Bazaar"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-cathedral/0596001088/) fame, The firt rule of being a Hacker is to solve a problem that you have and solve it once.

1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.
2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.

[Raymond, 2001](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)

## Problem Statement

The Author wants to travel the new decentralized world to build an Internet of freedom. To learn about this world he has to escape the prison of modern finance and pay the warden of Reserve Banking.

### Solution

Build a decentralized blogging platform with a cryptocurrency onramp.

## Business Requirements

1. Content
2. Accounting
3. Authentication
4. Authorization
5. Subscriptions
6. Payment

## Technical Requirements (Tech Spec)

1. Confidentiality
   Confidentiality can come from Public/Private Key Cryptography Infrastructure. (PKI)
2. Integrity
   The surest way to ensure something has Integrity in the current environment is through hashing or digital signing such as hash-based message functions.
3. Availability
   Availability from Distributed Hash Table (DHT) such as BitTorrent.

## Technical Specifications

### Core Infrastructure

Interplanetary File System (IPFS), Interplanetary Name System (IPNS), Interplanetary Linked Data (IPLD), and libp2p meet the core infrastructure needs as hosted by FileCoin.

# Hackathon

[HackFS](https://hackfs.com) has offered a Hackathon to build new applications, services or tools on FileCoin as sponsored by ETHGlobal and Protocol Labs.

### Our goals:

1. Learn how to collaborate in the new decentralized open source world through solving challenges together.
2. Join and meet the community and fellow freedom fighters on the Decentralized Web.
3. Build a working prototype of a hosted subscripton blog.
4. OPTIONAL: Have a payment onramp through blockchain cryptocurrencies such as DAI or other.
